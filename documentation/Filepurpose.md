# File Purpose Overview: 7-Stage Pipeline Implementation

This document maps each file in `AI/`, `server/`, and `relay/` folders to the **7-stage attack detection pipeline** documented in the README.

> **Audience & distribution note:** This is a **developer/auditor reference** tied to the Git repository layout. It assumes you have the full source tree checked out (AI/, server/, relay/) so you can inspect modules and JSON surfaces directly. **Production customers who install via the Linux .deb/.rpm packages or the Windows EXE normally do not see this folder structure**; they operate the packaged services using README and INSTALLATION. Use this file when you need to understand or verify how the runtime behavior maps back to individual source files.

## 🎯 Deployment Context for File Architecture

**Pipeline implementation varies by deployment role:**

| Deployment Role | What Pipelines Protect | File Locations |
|----------------|------------------------|----------------|
| **Gateway/Router** | Entire network segment (all devices) | Same AI/ server/ modules, different scope of traffic |
| **Host-only** | Local machine + terminated services | Same AI/ server/ modules, host traffic only |
| **Observer** | SPAN/mirror traffic (analysis only) | Same AI/ modules, no direct enforcement |

**Installation reference:** For deployment setup, see:
- [Installation.md § Deployment Role](installation/Installation.md#🎯-deployment-role-read-first)
- [Installation.md § Gateway Pre-Flight Checklist](installation/Installation.md#✅-gateway-pre-flight-checklist)
- [Installation.md § Linux Gateway Setup](installation/Installation.md#scenario-1-linux-gatewayrouter-network-wide-protection---recommended)

**Cloud deployment:** All file architectures and pipelines work identically on cloud VMs (AWS/Azure/GCP) with virtual NICs. Physical hardware not required.

---

### Stage 2: Parallel Multi-Signal Detection (20 Signals + Step 21 Semantic Gate)

**Purpose:** 20 independent detection systems produce threat assessments (18 primary + 2 strategic intelligence layers), then a Step 21 semantic execution-denial gate evaluates the request before any action for a total of **21 detection layers**.

#### 21 Detection Layers – Quick Reference

- **Layer 1 – eBPF Kernel Telemetry:** Correlates low-level syscalls and network activity to surface kernel-level anomalies and suspicious host behavior.
- **Layer 2 – Signature Matching:** Matches traffic, logs, and honeypot activity against curated signatures (local rules, ExploitDB-derived patterns, and learned_signatures) to spot known attacks.
- **Layer 3 – RandomForest Threat Classifier:** Supervised ML model that scores flows/hosts based on engineered features to classify them as benign, suspicious, or malicious.
- **Layer 4 – IsolationForest Anomaly Detector:** Unsupervised outlier detector that flags statistically rare behavior and novel attack patterns not yet covered by signatures.
- **Layer 5 – Gradient Boosting Reputation Model:** Learns a reputation score from historical behavior, intel hits, and recidivism to up- or down-rank entities over time.
- **Layer 6 – Behavioral Heuristics Engine:** Rule/heuristic layer that watches connection/auth patterns (low-and-slow scans, off-hours access, credential reuse) and assigns risk scores.
- **Layer 7 – LSTM Sequence Model:** Sequence model that tracks multi-step kill chains and APT-style campaigns across time, detecting coordinated sequences that may look benign in isolation.
- **Layer 8 – Traffic Analysis & Crypto-Mining Detector:** Examines protocol mix, destinations, and volume to detect anomalies, abuse patterns, and crypto-mining behavior.
- **Layer 9 – Drift Detection:** Monitors feature and model output distributions for drift, flagging when the environment has changed enough that models may be unreliable and retraining is required.
- **Layer 10 – Graph Intelligence Engine:** Builds and queries graphs of entities and connections to detect lateral movement, command-and-control structures, and high-risk choke points.
- **Layer 11 – VPN/Tor Fingerprinting:** Tracks VPN, Tor, and anonymization infrastructure usage so that otherwise borderline behavior from anonymized sources is treated with more caution.
- **Layer 12 – Threat Intelligence Feeds:** Correlates local activity with external IoCs and threat feeds (CVE, MalwareBazaar, URLhaus, OTX, etc.) to quickly flag known bad infrastructure.
- **Layer 13 – False Positive Filter:** Applies a multi-gate consensus and context check to downgrade noisy detections and reduce false positives before they reach operators.
- **Layer 14 – Historical Reputation Tracker:** Maintains long-term per-entity reputation and recidivism statistics, increasing scores for repeat offenders and decaying older incidents.
- **Layer 15 – Explainability Consistency Checks:** Generates explanations for decisions and can surface inconsistencies (e.g., high risk with weak supporting evidence) as an additional signal.
- **Layer 16 – Predictive Modeling & Forecasting:** Uses historical telemetry to forecast 24–48 hour risk windows and predict where attacks are likely to move next.
- **Layer 17 – Byzantine/Federated Defense:** Evaluates federated learning updates for poisoning attempts, rejecting suspicious updates and logging them as security events.
- **Layer 18 – Integrity & Lineage Monitoring:** Watches binaries, models, configs, and cryptographic lineage for tampering or unexpected changes and raises integrity violations.
- **Layer 19 – Causal Inference Engine (Strategic):** Distinguishes legitimate change, automation, and misconfiguration from real attacks, then modulates scores based on root cause.
- **Layer 20 – Trust Degradation Graph (Strategic):** Maintains a persistent 0–100 trust score per entity and applies non-linear penalties for repeated or severe abuse, influencing isolation/quarantine.
- **Layer 21 – Semantic Execution-Denial Gate:** Final semantic safety layer in pcs_ai/step21_semantic_gate that inspects the meaning of requested actions/operations and vetoes dangerous or out-of-policy intents even if numeric risk is borderline.

- **Purpose:** Distinguishes legitimate operational changes from disguised attacks
- **Inputs:** All detection outputs (1-20), deployment events, config changes, identity events (login/privilege changes)
- **Output:** Causal labels (LEGITIMATE_CAUSE, AUTOMATION_SIDE_EFFECT, EXTERNAL_ATTACK, INSIDER_MISUSE, MISCONFIGURATION, UNKNOWN_CAUSE)
- **Dual Role:** Participates in weighted voting (Step 1) AND applies causal modulation (Step 3)
- **Score Modulation:** Downgrade by -20% (legitimate), boost by +15% (attack), route to governance (misconfiguration)
- **Privacy:** Metadata-only analysis, no payloads/credentials/PII

**Signal #20: Trust Degradation Graph**

- **Trust Model:** 0-100 scale, event-weighted penalties (minor_anomaly=-5 to repeated_attack=-50), natural recovery (+1/day capped at 80% baseline)
- **Actions:** ALLOW (≥80), MONITOR (60-79), RATE_LIMIT (40-59), ISOLATE (20-39), QUARANTINE (<20)
- **Recidivism:** 3+ attacks in 7 days = exponential penalty
- **Dual Role:** Participates in weighted voting (Step 1) AND applies trust modulation (Step 4)
- **Position:** Influences final decision thresholds and can force quarantine regardless of score
- **Privacy:** SHA-256 entity hashing, no PII, statistical scores only

**Additional Detection Support:**
- `AI/dns_analyzer.py` — DNS tunneling/DGA detection (feeds Signal #2)
- `server/json/dns_security.json` — DNS analyzer metrics
- `AI/tls_fingerprint.py` — Encrypted C2 detection (feeds Signal #8)
- `server/json/tls_fingerprints.json` — TLS fingerprinting data

**Developer Path Guidelines (Stage 2 and Beyond):**
- When adding or modifying detection layers, always resolve local JSON paths via the helpers in `AI/path_helper` (for example `get_json_file("threat_log.json")`, `get_threat_log_file()`), rather than hardcoding `server/json` or `/app/json`.
- ML models for new signals must load from the directory returned by `get_ml_models_dir()` so that training sync and relay-distributed updates remain consistent.
- Any new training exports intended for the relay (for example new `training_datasets/` or `reputation_data/` variants) should build their paths from `get_relay_training_dir()` and append a subdirectory, instead of embedding `relay/ai_training_materials` literals in AI modules.
- Documentation examples should describe JSON and relay locations in terms of these helpers ("JSON directory", "relay training directory") rather than fixed filesystem paths so that Docker/native deployments stay aligned.

### Stage 3: Ensemble Decision Engine (Sequential Intelligence Modulation)

**Purpose:** Combine 20 signals → weighted voting + causal/trust modulation → final decision (with a separate Step 21 semantic veto layer in `AI/pcs_ai.py`).

**AI Files:**
- `AI/meta_decision_engine.py` — Weighted voting, causal modulation, trust modulation, override logic
- `AI/causal_inference.py` — Root cause analysis (Layer 19)
- `AI/trust_graph.py` — Entity trust scoring (Layer 20)
- `server/json/meta_engine_config.json` — Signal weights (0.65-0.98)
- `server/json/decision_history.json` — Per-signal contributions audit
- `server/json/causal_analysis.json` — Causal inference results
- `server/json/trust_graph.json` — Entity trust state

**5-Step Modulation Flow (as implemented):**

**Note:** All 20 signals (including Layers 19 and 20) participate in Step 1 weighted voting. Layers 19 and 20 then apply **additional modulation** in Steps 3-4 to refine the decision based on causal context and trust state. After the ensemble decision, `AI/pcs_ai.py` invokes the Step 21 semantic gate (`AI/step21_semantic_gate.py`) as a final veto layer before any response is returned.

**Step 1: Weighted Voting (All Signals 1–20)**
- Calculate base score: Σ(weight × confidence × is_threat) / Σ(weight)
- Signal weights: Honeypot 0.98, Threat Intel 0.95, Graph 0.92, Integrity 0.90, Signature 0.90, Trust 0.90, Causal 0.88, LSTM 0.85, Reputation 0.85, FP Filter 0.82, Autoencoder 0.80, RandomForest 0.80, Gradient Boost 0.78, Explainability 0.78, Behavioral 0.75, IsolationForest 0.75, VPN/Tor 0.70, Drift 0.65

**Step 2: Authoritative Signal Boosting**
- Honeypot (confidence ≥0.7) → force score to 90%+
- Threat Intel (confidence ≥0.9) → force score to 90%+
- False Positive Filter (5/5 gates) → boost +10%

**Step 3: Causal Inference Modulation (Layer 19)**
- LEGITIMATE_CAUSE (≥0.85 confidence) → score -20%
- AUTOMATION_SIDE_EFFECT (≥0.80 confidence) → score -15%
- EXTERNAL_ATTACK (≥0.80 confidence) → score +15%
- INSIDER_MISUSE (≥0.75 confidence) → score +10%
- MISCONFIGURATION → route to governance (no auto-block)
- UNKNOWN_CAUSE → human review required

**Step 4: Trust Degradation Modulation (Layer 20)**
- Trust ≥80 → normal operation (no extra boost)
- Trust 60-79 → monitoring (+5% score boost on ensemble vote)
- Trust 40-59 → rate limiting (+10% score boost on ensemble vote)
- Trust 20-39 → isolation (+15% score boost; block once weighted vote ≥60%)
- Trust <20 → auto-quarantine (force block regardless of ensemble score)

**Step 5: Final Decision with Override Logic**
- Global block threshold: 0.75 by default (overridable via `BLOCK_THRESHOLD` env); if `APT_DETECTION_MODE=true`, the engine lowers this to at most 0.70.
- Trust action "quarantine" → force block regardless of weighted score.
- Trust action "isolate" → block if weighted score ≥0.60 (even if global block threshold is higher).
- Otherwise: block if weighted score ≥block_threshold; log-only if weighted score ≥0.50; allow below 0.50.

- `AI/policy_governance.py` — Approval workflows
- `AI/emergency_killswitch.py` — SAFE_MODE override
- `AI/file_rotation.py` — ML training log rotation utility (auto-rotates at 100MB for memory safety)

**ML Training Log Rotation:** Files used for ML training (`threat_log.json`, `comprehensive_audit.json`, `global_attacks.json`, `learned_signatures.json`) automatically rotate when reaching 100MB (optimized for resource-constrained environments). When rotation occurs, the current file is renamed with a numeric suffix (e.g., `threat_log.json` → `threat_log_1.json`), and a new file is created. This ensures continuous logging without unbounded file growth while preserving all historical attack data for ML training.
