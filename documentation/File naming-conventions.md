# File naming conventions

This repository uses consistent capitalization styles for documentation filenames and headings.

- **Sentence case**: Used for sentences and many section headings. Only the first word and proper nouns are capitalized (for example, "Hello world").
- **Capitalized / sentence-style capitalization**: In software contexts, this often means "capitalize the first letter of a word and leave the other letters as lowercase".
- **Proper case**: The first letter of every word is uppercase and the rest are lowercase (similar to Excel's `PROPER()` or "Capitalize Each Word").
- **Initial cap**: Capitalize only the first letter of a single word.

Contextual usage in this project:

- For whole sentences and descriptive headings, we prefer **sentence case**.
- For single-word labels in navigation or UI, we use **capitalized** or **initial cap**.
- For documentation titles and filenames, we use a simplified **proper case** (each significant word capitalized, minor words optionally left lowercase) to keep names readable and professional.
